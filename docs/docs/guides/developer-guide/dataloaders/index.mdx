[Dataloaders](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) are used in GraphQL to solve the so called N+1 problem. This is an advanced performance optimization technique you may
want to use in your application if you find certain custom queries are slow or inefficient.

## N+1 problem

Imagine a cart with 20 items. Your implementation requires you to perform an `async` calculation `isSubscription` for each cart item which executes one or more queries each time it is called, and it takes pretty long on each execution. It works fine for a cart with 1 or 2 items. But with more than 15 items, suddenly the cart takes a **lot** longer to load. Especially when the site is busy.

The reason: the N+1 problem. Your cart is firing of 20 or more queries almost at the same time, adding **significantly** to the GraphQL request. It's like going to the McDonald's drive-in to get 10 hamburgers and getting in line 10 times to get 1 hamburger at a time. It's not efficient.

## The solution: dataloaders

Dataloaders allow you to say: instead of loading each field in the `grapqhl` tree one at a time, aggregate all the `ids` you want to execute the `async` calculation for, and then execute this for all the `ids` in one efficient `request`.

Dataloaders are generally used on `fieldResolver`s. Often, you will need a specific dataloader for each field resolver.

A Dataloader can return anything: `boolean`, `ProductVariant`, `string`, etc.

## Performance implications

Dataloaders can have a huge impact on performance. If your `fieldResolver` executes queries, and you log these queries, you should see a cascade of queries before the implementation of the dataloader, change to a single query using multiple `ids` after you implement it.

## Do I need this for `CustomField` relations? 

No, not normally. `CustomField` relations are automatically added to the root query for the `entity` that they are part of. So, they are loaded as part of the query that loads that entity.

## Example

We will provide a complete example here for you to use as a starting point. The skeleton created can handle multiple dataloaders across multiple channels. We will implement a `fieldResolver` called `isSubscription` for an `OrderLine` that will return a `true/false` for each incoming `orderLine`, to indicate whether the `orderLine` represents a subscription.


```ts title="src/plugins/my-plugin/api/api-extensions.ts"
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

export const shopApiExtensions = gql`
    extend type OrderLine {
        isSubscription: Boolean!
    }
`
```

This next part import the `dataloader` package, which you can install with

```bash
npm install dataloader
```

**Dataloader skeleton**

```ts title="src/plugins/my-plugin/api/dataloader.ts"
import DataLoader from 'dataloader'

const LoggerCtx = 'SubscriptionDataloaderService'

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST }) // Important! Dataloaders live at the request level
export class DataloaderService {

  /**
   * first level is channel identifier, second level is dataloader key
   */
  private loaders = new Map<string, Map<string, DataLoader<ID, any>>>()

  constructor(private service: SubscriptionExtensionService) {}

  getLoader(ctx: RequestContext, dataloaderKey: string) {
    const token = ctx.channel?.code ?? `${ctx.channelId}`
    
    Logger.debug(`Dataloader retrieval: ${token}, ${dataloaderKey}`, LoggerCtx)

    if (!this.loaders.has(token)) {
      this.loaders.set(token, new Map<string, DataLoader<ID, any>>())
    }

    const channelLoaders = this.loaders.get(token)!
    if (!channelLoaders.get(dataloaderKey)) {
      let loader: DataLoader<ID, any>

      switch (dataloaderKey) {
        case 'is-subscription':
          loader = new DataLoader<ID, any>((ids) =>
            this.batchLoadIsSubscription(ctx, ids as ID[]),
          )
          break
        // Implement cases for your other dataloaders here
        default:
          throw new Error(`Unknown dataloader key ${dataloaderKey}`)
      }

      channelLoaders.set(dataloaderKey, loader)
    }
    return channelLoaders.get(dataloaderKey)!
  }

  private async batchLoadIsSubscription(
    ctx: RequestContext,
    ids: ID[],
  ): Promise<Boolean[]> {
    // Returns an array of ids that represent those input ids that are subscriptions
    // Remember: this array can be smaller than the input array
    const subscriptionIds = await this.service.whichSubscriptions(ctx, ids)

    Logger.debug(`Dataloader is-subscription: ${ids}: ${subscriptionIds}`, LoggerCtx)

    return ids.map((id) => subscriptionIds.includes(id)) // Important! preserve order and size of input ids array
  }
}
```


```ts title="src/plugins/my-plugin/api/entity-resolver.ts"
@Resolver(() => OrderLine)
export class MyPluginOrderLineEntityResolver {
  constructor(
    private dataloaderService: DataloaderService,
  ) {}

  @ResolveField()
  isSubscription(@Ctx() ctx: RequestContext, @Parent() parent: OrderLine) {
    const loader = this.dataloaderService.getLoader(ctx, 'is-subscription')
    return loader.load(parent.id)
  }
}
```

To make it all work, ensure that the `DataLoaderService` is loaded in your `plugin` as a provider.

:::tip
Dataloaders map the result in the same order as the `ids` you send to the dataloader. 
Dataloaders expect the same order and array size in the return result. 

In other words: ensure that the order of your returned result is the same as the incoming `ids` and don't omit values!
