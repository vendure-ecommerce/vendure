title: "Storefront Starters"
---

Since building an entire Storefront from scratch can be a daunting task, we have prepared a few starter projects that you can use as a base for your own storefront.

These starters provide basic functionality including:

- Product listing
- Product details
- Search with facets
- Cart functionality
- Checkout flow
- Account management
- Styling with Tailwind

The idea is that you clone the starter project and then customize it to your needs.
