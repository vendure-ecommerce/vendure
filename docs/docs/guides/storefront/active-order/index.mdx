title: "Managing the Active Order"
---

import Stackblitz from '@site/src/components/Stackblitz';

The "active order" is what is also known as the "cart" - it is the order that is currently being worked on by the customer.

An order remains active until it is completed, and during this time it can be modified by the customer in various ways:

- Adding an item
- Removing an item
- Changing the quantity of items
- Applying a coupon
- Removing a coupon

This guide will cover how to manage the active order.

## Define an Order fragment

Since all the mutations that we will be using in this guide require an `Order` object, we will define a fragment that we can
reuse in all of our mutations.

```ts title="src/fragments.ts"
const ACTIVE_ORDER_FRAGMENT = /*GraphQL*/`
fragment ActiveOrder on Order {
  __typename
  id
  code
  couponCodes
  state
  currencyCode
  totalQuantity
  subTotalWithTax
  shippingWithTax
  totalWithTax
  discounts {
    description
    amountWithTax
  }
  lines {
    id
    unitPriceWithTax
    quantity
    linePriceWithTax
    productVariant {
      id
      name
      sku
    }
    featuredAsset {
      id
      preview
    }
  }
  shippingLines {
    shippingMethod {
      description
    }
    priceWithTax
  }
}`
```

:::note
The `__typename` field is used to determine the type of the object returned by the GraphQL server. In this case, it will always be `'Order'`.

Some GraphQL clients such as Apollo Client will automatically add the `__typename` field to all queries and mutations, but if you are using a different client you may need to add it manually.
:::

This fragment can then be used in subsequent queries and mutations by using the `...` spread operator in the place where an `Order` object is expected.
You can then embed the fragment in the query or mutation by using the `${ACTIVE_ORDER_FRAGMENT}` syntax:

```ts title="src/queries.ts"
import { ACTIVE_ORDER_FRAGMENT } from './fragments';

export const GET_ACTIVE_ORDER = /*GraphQL*/`
  query GetActiveOrder {
    activeOrder {
      // highlight-next-line
      ...ActiveOrder
    }
  }
  // highlight-next-line
  ${ACTIVE_ORDER_FRAGMENT}
`;
```

For the remainder of this guide, we will list just the body of the query or mutation, and assume that the fragment is defined and imported as above.

## Get the active order

This fragment can then be used in subsequent queries and mutations. Let's start with a query to get the active order using the [`activeOrder` query](/reference/graphql-api/shop/queries#activeorder):

```graphql
query GetActiveOrder {
  activeOrder {
    ...ActiveOrder
  }
}
```

## Add an item

To add an item to the active order, we use the [`addItemToOrder` mutation](/reference/graphql-api/shop/mutations/#additemtoorder), as we have seen in the [Product Detail Page guide](/guides/storefront/product-detail/).

```graphql
mutation AddItemToOrder($productVariantId: ID!, $quantity: Int!) {
  addItemToOrder(productVariantId: $productVariantId, quantity: $quantity) {
    ...ActiveOrder
    ... on ErrorResult {
      errorCode
      message
    }
    ... on InsufficientStockError {
      quantityAvailable
      order {
        ...ActiveOrder
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::info
If you have defined any custom fields on the `OrderLine` entity, you will be able to pass them as a `customFields` argument to the `addItemToOrder` mutation.
See the [Configurable Products guide](/guides/how-to/configurable-products/) for more information.
:::

## Remove an item

To remove an item from the active order, we use the [`removeOrderLine` mutation](/reference/graphql-api/shop/mutations/#removeorderline),
and pass the `id` of the `OrderLine` to remove.

```graphql
mutation RemoveItemFromOrder($orderLineId: ID!) {
  removeOrderLine(orderLineId: $orderLineId) {
    ...ActiveOrder
    ... on ErrorResult {
      errorCode
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Change the quantity of an item

To change the quantity of an item in the active order, we use the [`adjustOrderLine` mutation](/reference/graphql-api/shop/mutations/#adjustorderline).

```graphql
mutation AdjustOrderLine($orderLineId: ID!, $quantity: Int!) {
  adjustOrderLine(orderLineId: $orderLineId, quantity: $quantity) {
    ...ActiveOrder
    ... on ErrorResult {
        errorCode
        message
    }
  }
}
```

:::info
If you have defined any custom fields on the `OrderLine` entity, you will be able to update their values by passing a `customFields` argument to the `adjustOrderLine` mutation.
See the [Configurable Products guide](/guides/how-to/configurable-products/) for more information.

## Applying a coupon code

If you have defined any [Promotions](/guides/core-concepts/promotions/) which use coupon codes, you can apply the a coupon code to the active order
using the [`applyCouponCode` mutation](/reference/graphql-api/shop/mutations/#applycouponcode).

```graphql
mutation ApplyCouponCode($couponCode: String!) {
  applyCouponCode(couponCode: $couponCode) {
    ...ActiveOrder
    ... on ErrorResult {
      errorCode
      message
    }
  }
}
```

## Removing a coupon code

To remove a coupon code from the active order, we use the [`removeCouponCode` mutation](/reference/graphql-api/shop/mutations/#removecouponcode).

```graphql
mutation RemoveCouponCode($couponCode: String!) {
  removeCouponCode(couponCode: $couponCode) {
    ...ActiveOrder
    ... on ErrorResult {
      errorCode
      message
    }
  }
}
```
