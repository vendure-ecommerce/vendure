metaTitle: "Localizing Vendure Dashboard Extensions with Lingui"
metaDescription: "Add multi-language support to your Vendure Dashboard extensions using Lingui for string extraction, translation catalogs, and ICU MessageFormat."
---

:::note
Support for localization of Dashboard extensions was added in v3.5.1
:::

The Dashboard uses [Lingui](https://lingui.dev/), which provides a powerful i18n solution for React:

- ICU MessageFormat support
- Automatic message extraction
- TypeScript integration
- Pluralization support
- Compile-time optimization

## Wrap your strings

First you'll need to wrap any strings that need to be localized:

```tsx
import { Trans, useLingui } from '@lingui/react/macro';

function MyComponent() {
    const { t } = useLingui();

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>
                <Trans>Welcome to Dashboard</Trans> {/* [!code highlight] */}
            </h1>
            <p>{t`Click here to continue`}</p> {/* [!code highlight] */}
        </div>
    );
}
```

You will mainly make use of the [Trans component](https://lingui.dev/ref/react#trans)
and the [useLingui hook](https://lingui.dev/ref/react#uselingui).

## Extract translations

Create a `lingui.config.js` file in your project root, with references to any plugins that need to be localized:

```js title="lingui.config.js
import { defineConfig } from '@lingui/cli';

export default defineConfig({
    sourceLocale: 'en',
    // Add any locales you wish to support
    locales: ['en', 'de'],
    catalogs: [
        // For each plugin you want to localize, add a catalog entry
        {
            // This is the output location of the generated .po files
            path: '<rootDir>/src/plugins/reviews/dashboard/i18n/{locale}',
            // This is the pattern that tells Lingui which files to scan
            // to extract translation strings
            include: ['<rootDir>/src/plugins/reviews/dashboard/**'],
        },
    ],
});
```

Then extract the translations:

```bash
npx lingui extract
```

This will output the given locale files in the directories specified in the config file above.
In this case:

```
src/
└── plugins/
    └── reviews/
        └── dashboard/
            └── i18n/
                ├── en.po
                └── de.po
```

Since we set the "sourceLocale" to be "en", the `en.po` file will already be complete. You'll then need to
open up the `de.po` file and add German translations for each of the strings, by filling out the empty `msgstr` values:

```text title="de.po"
#: test-plugins/reviews/dashboard/review-list.tsx:51
msgid "Welcome to Dashboard"
msgstr "Willkommen zum Dashboard" # [!code highlight]
```
