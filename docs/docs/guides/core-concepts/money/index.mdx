title: "Money & Currency"
---

In Vendure, monetary values are stored as **integers** using the **minor unit** of the selected currency.
For example, if the currency is set to USD, then the integer value `100` would represent $1.00.
This is a common practice in financial applications, as it avoids the rounding errors that can occur when using floating-point numbers.

For example, here's the response from a query for a product's variant prices:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "product": {
      "id": "42",
      "variants": [
        {
          "id": "74",
          "name": "Bonsai Tree",
          "currencyCode": "USD",
          // highlight-start
          "price": 1999,
          "priceWithTax": 2399,
          // highlight-end
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the tax-inclusive price of the variant is `$23.99`.

:::info
To illustrate the problem with storing money as decimals, imagine that we want to add the price of two items:

- Product A: `$1.21`
- Product B: `$1.22`

We should expect the sum of these two amounts to equal `$2.43`. However, if we perform this addition in JavaScript (and the same
holds true for most common programming languages), we will instead get `$2.4299999999999997`!

## Displaying monetary values

When you are building your storefront, or any other client that needs to display monetary values in a human-readable form,
you need to divide by 100 to convert to the major currency unit and then format with the correct decimal & grouping dividers.

In JavaScript environments such as browsers & Node.js, we can take advantage of the excellent [`Intl.NumberFormat` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat).

Here's a function you can use in your projects:

```ts title="src/utils/format-currency.ts"
export function formatCurrency(value: number, currencyCode: string, locale?: string) {
    const majorUnits = value / 100;
    try {
        // Note: if no `locale` is provided, the browser's default
        // locale will be used.
        return new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, {
            style: 'currency',
            currency: currencyCode,
        }).format(majorUnits);
    } catch (e: any) {
        // A fallback in case the NumberFormat fails for any reason
        return majorUnits.toFixed(2);
    }
}
```

If you are building an Admin UI extension, you can use the built-in [`LocaleCurrencyPipe`](/reference/admin-ui-api/pipes/locale-currency-pipe/):

```html title="src/plugins/my-plugin/ui/components/my-component/my.component.html"
<div>
    Variant price: {{ variant.price | localeCurrency : variant.currencyCode }}
</div>
```


## The GraphQL `Money` scalar

In the GraphQL APIs, we use a custom [`Money` scalar type](/reference/graphql-api/admin/object-types/#money) to represent
all monetary values. We do this for two reasons:

1. The built-in `Int` type is that the GraphQL spec imposes an upper limit of
`2147483647`, which in some cases (especially currencies with very large amounts) is not enough.
2. Very advanced use-cases might demand more precision than is possible with an integer type. Using our own custom
scalar gives us the possibility of supporting more precision.

Here's how the `Money` scalar is used in the `ShippingLine` type:

```graphql
type ShippingLine {
    id: ID!
    shippingMethod: ShippingMethod!
    // highlight-start
    price: Money!
    priceWithTax: Money!
    discountedPrice: Money!
    discountedPriceWithTax: Money!
    // highlight-end
    discounts: [Discount!]!
}
```

If you are defining custom GraphQL types, or adding fields to existing types (see the [Extending the GraphQL API doc](/guides/developer-guide/extend-graphql-api/)),
then you should also use the `Money` scalar for any monetary values.


## The `@Money()` decorator

When [defining new database entities](/guides/developer-guide/database-entity//), if you need to store a monetary value, then rather than using the TypeORM `@Column()`
decorator, you should use Vendure's [`@Money()` decorator](/reference/typescript-api/money/money-decorator).

Using this decorator allows Vendure to correctly store the value in the database according to the configured `MoneyStrategy` (see below).

```ts title="src/plugins/quote/entities/quote.entity.ts"
import { DeepPartial } from '@vendure/common/lib/shared-types';
import { VendureEntity, Order, EntityId, Money, CurrencyCode, ID } from '@vendure/core';
import { Column, Entity, ManyToOne } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
class Quote extends VendureEntity {
    constructor(input?: DeepPartial<Quote>) {
        super(input);
    }

    @ManyToOne(type => Order)
    order: Order;

    @EntityId()
    orderId: ID;

    @Column()
    text: string;

    // highlight-start
    @Money()
    value: number;
    // highlight-end

    // Whenever you store a monetary value, it's a good idea to also
    // explicitly store the currency code too. This makes it possible
    // to support multiple currencies and correctly format the amount
    // when displaying the value.
    @Column('varchar')
    currencyCode: CurrencyCode;

    @Column()
    approved: boolean;
}
```

## Advanced configuration: MoneyStrategy

For advanced use-cases, it is possible to configure aspects of how Vendure handles monetary values internally by defining
a custom [`MoneyStrategy`](/reference/typescript-api/money/money-strategy/).

The `MoneyStrategy` allows you to define:

- How the value is stored and retrieved from the database
- How rounding is applied internally

For example, in addition to the [`DefaultMoneyStrategy`](/reference/typescript-api/money/default-money-strategy), Vendure
also provides the [`BigIntMoneyStrategy`](/reference/typescript-api/money/big-int-money-strategy) which stores monetary values
using the `bigint` data type, allowing much larger amounts to be stored.

Here's how you would configure your server to use this strategy:

```ts title="src/vendure-config.ts"
import { VendureConfig, BigIntMoneyStrategy } from '@vendure/core';

export const config: VendureConfig = {
    // ...
    entityOptions: {
        moneyStrategy: new BigIntMoneyStrategy(),
    }
}
```
