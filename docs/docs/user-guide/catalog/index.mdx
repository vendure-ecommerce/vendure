The Catalog section covers managing your store's products, collections, and facets.

## Products

Products are the items you sell. Each product can have multiple variants with different options like size, color, etc. See [Products](/user-guide/catalog/products) for details.

## Collections

Collections are used to group products for display in your storefront, such as "New Arrivals" or "Summer Sale". See [Collections](/user-guide/catalog/collections) for details.

## Facets

Facets are used to categorize products and enable filtering. For example, "Brand" or "Material" facets allow customers to narrow down product searches. See [Facets](/user-guide/catalog/facets) for details.
