## dummyPaymentHandler

<GenerationInfo sourceFile="packages/core/src/config/payment/dummy-payment-method-handler.ts" sourceLine="27" packageName="@vendure/core" />

A dummy PaymentMethodHandler which simply creates a Payment without any integration
with an external payment provider. Intended only for use in development.

By specifying certain metadata keys, failures can be simulated:

*Example*

```graphql
addPaymentToOrder(input: {
  method: 'dummy-payment-method',
  metadata: {
    shouldDecline: false,
    shouldError: false,
    shouldErrorOnSettle: true,
  }
}) {
  # ...
}
```
