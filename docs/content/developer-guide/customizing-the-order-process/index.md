# Customizing the Order Process

Vendure defines an order process which is based on a [finite state machine]({{< relref "fsm" >}}). This means that the [`Order.state` property]({{< relref "order" >}}#state) will be one of a set of [pre-defined states]({{< relref "order-state" >}}). From the current state, the Order can then transition (change) to another state, and the available next states depend on what the current state is.

So, as an example, all orders being in the `AddingItems` state. This means that the Customer is adding items to his or her shopping cart. From there, the Order can transition to the `ArrangingPayment` state. A diagram of the default states and transitions can be found in the [Order Workflow guide]({{< relref "order-workflow" >}}).

## Defining custom states and transitions

Sometimes you might need to modify the default Order process to better match your business needs. This is done by defining one or more [`CustomOrderProcess`]({{< relref "custom-order-process" >}}) objects and passing them to the [`OrderOptions.process`]({{< relref "order-options" >}}#process) config property.

### Example: Adding a new state

Let's say your company can only sell to customers with a valid EU tax ID. We'll assume that you've already used a [custom field]({{< relref "customizing-models" >}}) to store that code on the Customer entity.

Now you want to add a step _before_ the customer handles payment, where we can collect and verify the tax ID.

So we want to change the default process of:

```text
AddingItems -> ArrangingPayment
```

to instead be:

```text
AddingItems -> ValidatingCustomer -> ArrangingPayment
```

Here's how we would define the new state:

```TypeScript
// customer-validation-process.ts
import { CustomOrderProcess } from '@vendure/core';

export const customerValidationProcess: CustomOrderProcess<'ValidatingCustomer'> = {
  transitions: {
    AddingItems: {
      to: ['ValidatingCustomer'],
      mergeStrategy: 'replace',
    },
    ValidatingCustomer: {
      to: ['ArrangingPayment', 'AddingItems'],
    },
  },
};
```
This object means:

* the `AddingItems` state may _only_ transition to the `ValidatingCustomer` state (`mergeStrategy: 'replace'` tells Vendure to discard any existing transition targets and replace with this one). 
* the `ValidatingCustomer` may transition to the `ArrangingPayment` state (assuming the tax ID is valid) or back to the `AddingItems` state.

And then add this configuration to our main VendureConfig:

```TypeScript
// vendure-config.ts
import { VendureConfig } from '@vendure/core';
import { customerValidationProcess } from './customer-validation-process';

export const config: VendureConfig = {
  // ...
  orderOptions: {
    process: [customerValidationProcess],
  },
};
```

 To add multiple new States you need to extend the generic type like this:
 ```TypeScript
import { CustomOrderProcess } from '@vendure/core';

export const customerValidationProcess: CustomOrderProcess<'ValidatingCustomer'|'AnotherState'> = {...}
 ```
This way multiple custom states gets defined.

### Example: Intercepting a state transition

Now we have defined out new `ValidatingCustomer` state, but there is as yet nothing to enforce that the tax ID is valid. To add this constraint, we'll use the [`onTransitionStart` state transition hook]({{< relref "state-machine-config" >}}#ontransitionstart).

This allows us to perform our custom logic and potentially prevent the transition from occurring. We will also assume that we have available a provider named `TaxIdService` which contains the logic to validate a tax ID.

```TypeScript
// customer-validation-process.ts

// We declare this in the outer scope and can then use it 
// in our onTransitionStart function.
let taxIdService: TaxIdService;

const customerValidationProcess: CustomOrderProcess<'ValidatingCustomer'> = {
  transitions: {
    AddingItems: {
      to: ['ValidatingCustomer'],
      mergeStrategy: 'replace',
    },
    ValidatingCustomer: {
      to: ['ArrangingPayment', 'AddingItems'],
    },
  },

  // The init method allows us to inject services
  // and other providers
  init(injector) {
    taxIdService = injector.get(TaxIdService);
  },

  // The logic for enforcing our validation goes here
  async onTransitionStart(fromState, toState, data) {
    if (fromState === 'ValidatingCustomer' && toState === 'ArrangingPayment') {
      const isValid = await taxIdService.verifyTaxId(data.order.customer);
      if (!isValid) {
        // Returning a string is interpreted as an error message.
        // The state transition will fail.
        return `The tax ID is not valid`;
      }
    }
  },
};

```

## Controlling custom states in the Admin UI

If you have defined custom order states, the Admin UI will allow you to manually transition an 
order from one state to another:
