# AssetNamingStrategy

{{< generation-info sourceFile="packages/core/src/config/asset-naming-strategy/asset-naming-strategy.ts" sourceLine="11" packageName="@vendure/core">}}

The AssetNamingStrategy determines how file names are generated based on the uploaded source file name,
as well as how to handle naming conflicts.

## Signature

```TypeScript
interface AssetNamingStrategy extends InjectableStrategy {
  generateSourceFileName(ctx: RequestContext, originalFileName: string, conflictFileName?: string): string;
  generatePreviewFileName(ctx: RequestContext, sourceFileName: string, conflictFileName?: string): string;
}
```

## Members

### generateSourceFileName

{{< member-info kind="method" type="(ctx: <a href='/typescript-api/request/request-context#requestcontext'>RequestContext</a>, originalFileName: string, conflictFileName?: string) => string"  >}}

{{< member-description >}}Given the original file name of the uploaded file, generate a file name to
be stored on the server. Operations like normalization and time-stamping can
be performed in this method.

The output will be checked for a naming conflict with an existing file. If a conflict
exists, this method will be invoked again with the second argument passed in and a new, unique
file name should then be generated. This process will repeat until a unique file name has
been returned.{{< /member-description >}}

### generatePreviewFileName

{{< member-info kind="method" type="(ctx: <a href='/typescript-api/request/request-context#requestcontext'>RequestContext</a>, sourceFileName: string, conflictFileName?: string) => string"  >}}

{{< member-description >}}Given the source file name generated in the `generateSourceFileName` method, this method
should generate the file name of the preview image.

The same mechanism of checking for conflicts is used as described above.{{< /member-description >}}
