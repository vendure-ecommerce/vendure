# UI Extensions with Angular

Writing your UI extensions with Angular results in the best-optimized and most seamless UI extensions, since you can re-use shared components exported by the `@vendure/admin-ui/core` library, and the Angular framework itself is already present in the app.

{{< alert warning >}}
**Note:** an understanding of [Angular](https://angular.io/) is necessary for successfully working with Angular-based UI extensions. Try [Angular's "Getting Started" guide](https://angular.io/start) to learn more.
{{< /alert >}}

## 1. Install `@vendure/ui-devkit`

To create UI extensions, you'll need to install the `@vendure/ui-devkit` package. This package contains a compiler for building your customized version of the Admin UI, as well as the Angular dependencies you'll need to create your extensions.

```bash
yarn add @vendure/ui-devkit

# or

npm install @vendure/ui-devkit
```

## 2. Create a simple component

Here's a very simple Angular component which displays a greeting:

```TypeScript
// project/ui-extensions/greeter.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'greeter',
  template: `<h1>{{ greeting }}</h1>`,
})
export class GreeterComponent {
  greeting = 'Hello!';
}
```

## 3. Create the Angular module

Next we need to declare an Angular module to house the component:

```TypeScript
// project/ui-extensions/greeter.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { SharedModule } from '@vendure/admin-ui/core';
import { GreeterComponent } from './greeter.component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    SharedModule,
    RouterModule.forChild([{
      path: '',
      pathMatch: 'full',
      component: GreeterComponent,
      data: { breadcrumb: 'Greeter' },
    }]),
  ],
  declarations: [GreeterComponent],
})
export class GreeterModule {}
```

{{< alert "primary" >}}
**Note:** The `SharedModule` should, in general, always be imported by your extension modules. It provides the basic Angular
directives and other common functionality that any extension would require.

## 4. Pass the extension to the `compileUiExtensions` function

Now we need to tell the `compileUiExtensions` function where to find the extension, and which file contains the NgModule itself (since a non-trivial UI extension will likely contain multiple files).

```TypeScript
// project/vendure-config.ts
import path from 'path';
import { AdminUiPlugin } from '@vendure/admin-ui-plugin';
import { VendureConfig } from '@vendure/core';
import { compileUiExtensions } from '@vendure/ui-devkit/compiler';

export const config: VendureConfig = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    AdminUiPlugin.init({
      port: 5001,
      app: compileUiExtensions({
        outputPath: path.join(__dirname, '../admin-ui'),
        extensions: [{
          extensionPath: path.join(__dirname, 'ui-extensions'),
          ngModules: [{
            type: 'lazy',
            route: 'greet',
            ngModuleFileName: 'greeter.module.ts',
            ngModuleName: 'GreeterModule',
          }],
        }],
      }),
    }),
  ],
}
```

## 5. Start the server to compile

The `compileUiExtensions()` function returns a `compile()` function which will be invoked by the AdminUiPlugin upon server bootstrap. During this compilation process, a new directory will be generated at `/admin-ui` (as specified by the `outputPath` option) which will contains the un-compiled sources of your new Admin UI app.

Next, these source files will be run through the Angular compiler, the output of which will be visible in the console.

{{< alert "warning" >}}
**Note:** The first time the compiler is run, an additional step ([compatibility compiler](https://angular.io/guide/ivy#ivy-and-libraries)) is run to make sure all dependencies work with the latest version of Angular. This step can take up to a few minutes.
{{< /alert >}}

Now go to the Admin UI app in your browser and log in. You should now be able to manually enter the URL `http://localhost:3000/admin/extensions/greet` and you should see the component with the "Hello!" header:

{{< figure src="./ui-extensions-greeter.jpg" >}}

{{< alert warning >}}
**Note:** the TypeScript source files of your UI extensions **must not** be compiled by your regular TypeScript build task. This is because they will instead be compiled by the Angular compiler when you run `compileUiExtensions()`. You can exclude them in your main `tsconfig.json` by adding a line to the "exclude" array:
```json
{
  "exclude": [
    "src/plugins/**/ui/*"
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

Now you have created your new route, you need a way for your admin to access it. See [Adding Navigation Items]({{< relref "../adding-navigation-items" >}})
