# Deployment Guides

This section contains guides for deploying a Vendure application to production.

For a quick and simple deployment, we recommend following the [Deploying to Northflank guide]({{< relref "deploy-to-northflank" >}}).

Community-contributed information about deploying to other platforms can be found in our [Deployment discussion category](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/discussions/categories/deployment).
