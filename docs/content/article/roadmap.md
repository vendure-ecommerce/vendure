## Vendure beta ➡ v1.0

Here is a list of some of the main outstanding tasks that are planned for the v1.0 release, at which point Vendure will come out of beta:

* Complete the Channels implementation
* Back order handling
* Administrator creation & editing of orders
* Custom authentication support
* Improved promotions support
* Improved tax calculation support
* Improved support for running Vendure in cloud environments
* Performance improvements

We currently hope to **reach v1.0 in the latter half of 2020**. For an up-to-date overview of where we stand, refer to the [GitHub milestones page](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/milestones).

## Post v1.0

Once we hit v1.0, Vendure will continue to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). We'll aim for a steady cadence of major releases, perhaps every 6 months. Newer, breaking changes will be available via a `next` branch and release tag. 

## Long-term

Vendure is in this for the long-term. This is not a venture-backed start-up looking for an exit. We plan to grow Vendure into the go-to solution for Node.js e-commerce with a solid, stable core and vibrant community. Post v1.0 we will be introducing a set of commercial plugins covering some more advanced use-cases.
