## Vendure beta âž¡ v1.0

Vendure is soon to enter the v1.0-beta phase. At that point no more breaking changes are planned. Non-breaking features and fixes will then be added over a period of one to several months while we progress from beta to release candidate. At that point, the final v1.0 state will be released. This is currently planned for around April 2021.

 For an up-to-date overview of where we stand, refer to the [v1.0 milestone on GitHub](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/milestones/4).

## Post v1.0

Once we hit v1.0, Vendure will continue to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). We'll aim for a steady cadence of major releases, perhaps every 6 months. Newer, breaking changes will be available via a `next` branch and release tag. 

## Long-term

Vendure is in this for the long-term. The project is backed by a successful UK-based retailer who have been in e-commerce for over 15 years. We plan to grow Vendure into the go-to solution for Node.js e-commerce with a solid, stable core and vibrant community. Post v1.0 we will be introducing a set of commercial plugins covering some more advanced use-cases.
