Vendure Plugin Exception

0. Definitions

"Vendure Core" includes all the source code files included in this repository, which are licensed under the
GPL v3.0 license.

A "Plugin" is a software module that is designed to enable additional functionality by
 using APIs exposed by the Vendure Core packages, including but not limited to the public
APIs described in the Vendure documentation at https://docs.vendure.io. A Plugin does not include any source code from
the Vendure Core itself.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

For Plugins that are distributed separately from Vendure Core (such as via a package repository),
Vendure GmbH hereby grants you permission to link the Vendure Core from that Plugin and to
distribute the Plugin under terms of your choice, including licenses which are not compatible with the GPL v3.0,
 without any of the additional requirements listed in the GNU Library General Public License.

(The GPL v3.0 restrictions do apply in other respects; for example, they cover modifications made to the Vendure Core.)
