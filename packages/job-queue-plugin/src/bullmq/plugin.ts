/**
 * @description
 * This plugin is a drop-in replacement of the DefaultJobQueuePlugin, which implements a push-based
 * job queue strategy built on top of the popular [BullMQ](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq) library.
 *
 * ## Advantages over the DefaultJobQueuePlugin
 *
 * The advantage of this approach is that jobs are stored in Redis rather than in the database. For more complex
 * applications with many job queues and/or multiple worker instances, this can massively reduce the load on the
 * DB server. The reason for this is that the DefaultJobQueuePlugin uses polling to check for new jobs. By default
 * it will poll every 200ms. A typical Vendure instance uses at least 3 queues (handling emails, collections, search index),
 * so even with a single worker instance this results in 15 queries per second to the DB constantly. Adding more
 * custom queues and multiple worker instances can easily result in 50 or 100 queries per second. At this point
 * performance may be impacted.
 *
 * Using this plugin, no polling is needed, as BullMQ will _push_ jobs to the worker(s) as and when they are added
 * to the queue. This results in significantly more scalable performance characteristics, as well as lower latency
 * in processing jobs.
 *
 * ## Installation
 *
 * Note: To use this plugin, you need to manually install the `bullmq` package:
 *
 * ```shell
 * npm install bullmq@^5.4.2
 * ```
 *
 * **Note:** The v1.x version of this plugin is designed to work with bullmq v1.x, etc.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { BullMQJobQueuePlugin } from '\@vendure/job-queue-plugin/package/bullmq';
 *
 * const config: VendureConfig = {
 *   // Add an instance of the plugin to the plugins array
 *   plugins: [
 *     // DefaultJobQueuePlugin should be removed from the plugins array
 *     BullMQJobQueuePlugin.init({
 *       connection: {
 *         port: 6379
 *       }
 *     }),
 *   ],
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * ### Running Redis locally
 *
 * To develop with this plugin, you'll need an instance of Redis to connect to. Here's a docker-compose config
 * that will set up [Redis](https://redis.io/) as well as [Redis Commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander),
 * which is a web-based UI for interacting with Redis:
 *
 * ```YAML
 * version: "3"
 * services:
 *   redis:
 *     image: redis:7.4
 *     hostname: redis
 *     container_name: redis
 *     ports:
 *       - "6379:6379"
 *   redis-commander:
 *     container_name: redis-commander
 *     hostname: redis-commander
 *     image: rediscommander/redis-commander:latest
 *     environment:
 *       - REDIS_HOSTS=local:redis:6379
 *     ports:
 *       - "8085:8081"
 * ```
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * The default concurrency of a single worker is 3, i.e. up to 3 jobs will be processed at the same time.
 * You can change the concurrency in the `workerOptions` passed to the `init()` method:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const config: VendureConfig = {
 *   plugins: [
 *     BullMQJobQueuePlugin.init({
 *       workerOptions: {
 *         concurrency: 10,
 *       },
 *     }),
 *   ],
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * ## Removing old jobs
 *
 * By default, BullMQ will keep completed jobs in the `completed` set and failed jobs in the `failed` set. Over time,
 * these sets can grow very large. Since Vendure v2.1, the default behaviour is to remove jobs from these sets after
 * 30 days or after a maximum of 5,000 completed or failed jobs.
 *
 * This can be configured using the `removeOnComplete` and `removeOnFail` options:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const config: VendureConfig = {
 *   plugins: [
 *     BullMQJobQueuePlugin.init({
 *       workerOptions: {
 *         removeOnComplete: {
 *           count: 500,
 *         },
 *         removeOnFail: {
 *           age: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
 *           count: 1000,
 *         },
 *       }
 *     }),
 *   ],
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * The `count` option specifies the maximum number of jobs to keep in the set, while the `age` option specifies the
 * maximum age of a job in seconds. If both options are specified, then the jobs kept will be the ones that satisfy
 * both properties.
 *
 * ## Job Priority
 * Some jobs are more important than others. For example, sending out a timely email after a customer places an order
 * is probably more important than a routine data import task. Sometimes you can get the situation where lower-priority
 * jobs are blocking higher-priority jobs.
 *
 * Let's say you have a data import job that runs periodically and takes a long time to complete. If you have a high-priority
 * job that needs to be processed quickly, it could be stuck behind the data import job in the queue. A customer might
 * not get their confirmation email for 30 minutes while that data import job is processed!
 *
 * To solve this problem, you can set the `priority` option on a job. Jobs with a higher priority will be processed before
 * jobs with a lower priority. By default, all jobs have a priority of 0 (which is the highest).
 *
 * Learn more about how priority works in BullMQ in their [documentation](https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/jobs/prioritized).
 *
 * You can set the priority by using the `setJobOptions` option (introduced in Vendure v3.2.0):
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const config: VendureConfig = {
 *   plugins: [
 *     BullMQJobQueuePlugin.init({
 *       setJobOptions: (queueName, job) => {
 *         let priority = 10;
 *         switch (queueName) {
 *           case 'super-critical-task':
 *             priority = 0;
 *             break;
 *           case 'send-email':
 *             priority = 5;
 *             break;
 *           default:
 *             priority = 10;
 *         }
 *         return { priority };
 *       }
 *     }),
 *   ],
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * ## Setting Redis Prefix
 *
 * By default, the underlying BullMQ library will use the default Redis key prefix of `bull`. This can be changed by setting the `prefix` option
 * in the `queueOptions` and `workerOptions` objects:
 *
 * ```ts
 * BullMQJobQueuePlugin.init({
 *   workerOptions: {
 *     prefix: 'my-prefix'
 *   },
 *   queueOptions: {
 *     prefix: 'my-prefix'
 *   }
 * }),
 * ```
