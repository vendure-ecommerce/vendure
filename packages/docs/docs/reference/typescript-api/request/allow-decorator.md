## Allow

<GenerationInfo sourceFile="packages/core/src/api/decorators/allow.decorator.ts" sourceLine="51" packageName="@vendure/core" />

Attaches metadata to the resolver defining which permissions are required to execute the
operation, using one or more <a href='/reference/typescript-api/common/permission#permission'>Permission</a> values.

When multiple permissions are specified, the user needs only **one** of them (OR logic).
This is useful for operations that can be performed by users with different permission sets.

In a GraphQL context, it can be applied to top-level queries and mutations as well as field resolvers.

For REST controllers, it can be applied to route handler.

## Allow and Sessions
The `@Allow()` decorator is closely linked to the way Vendure manages sessions. For any operation or route that is decorated
with `@Allow()`, there must be an authenticated session in progress, which would have been created during a prior authentication
step.

The exception to this is when the operation is decorated with `@Allow(Permission.Owner)`. This is a special permission which is designed
to give access to certain resources to potentially un-authenticated users. For this reason, any operation decorated with this permission
will always have an anonymous session created if no session is currently in progress.

For more information see [Understanding Permission.Owner](/reference/typescript-api/common/permission/#understanding-permissionowner).

*Example*

```ts
 @Allow(Permission.SuperAdmin)
 @Query()
 getAdministrators() {
     // ...
 }
```

*Example*

```ts
 // User needs ReadProduct OR ReadCatalog (either grants access)
 @Allow(Permission.ReadProduct, Permission.ReadCatalog)
 @Query()
 getProducts() {
     // ...
 }
```
