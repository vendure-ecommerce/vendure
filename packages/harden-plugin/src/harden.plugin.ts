/**
 * @description
 * The HardenPlugin hardens the Shop and Admin GraphQL APIs against attacks and abuse.
 *
 * - It analyzes the complexity on incoming graphql queries and rejects queries that are too complex and
 *   could be used to overload the resources of the server.
 * - It disables dev-mode API features such as introspection and the GraphQL playground app.
 * - It removes field name suggestions to prevent trial-and-error schema sniffing.
 *
 * It is a recommended plugin for all production configurations.
 *
 * ## Installation
 *
 * `yarn add \@vendure/harden-plugin`
 *
 * or
 *
 * `npm install \@vendure/harden-plugin`
 *
 * Then add the `HardenPlugin`, calling the `.init()` method with {@link HardenPluginOptions}:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { HardenPlugin } from '\@vendure/harden-plugin';
 *
 * const config: VendureConfig = {
 *   // Add an instance of the plugin to the plugins array
 *   plugins: [
 *      HardenPlugin.init({
 *        maxQueryComplexity: 650,
 *        apiMode: process.env.APP_ENV === 'dev' ? 'dev' : 'prod',
 *      }),
 *   ],
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * ## Setting the max query complexity
 *
 * The `maxQueryComplexity` option determines how complex a query can be. The complexity of a query relates to how many, and how
 * deeply-nested are the fields being selected, and is intended to roughly correspond to the amount of server resources that would
 * be required to resolve that query.
 *
 * The goal of this setting is to prevent attacks in which a malicious actor crafts a very complex query in order to overwhelm your
 * server resources. Here's an example of a request which would likely overwhelm a Vendure server:
 *
 * ```GraphQL
 * query EvilQuery {
 *   products {
 *     items {
 *       collections {
 *         productVariants {
 *           items {
 *             product {
 *               collections {
 *                 productVariants {
 *                   items {
 *                     product {
 *                       variants {
 *                         name
 *                       }
 *                     }
 *                   }
 *                 }
 *               }
 *             }
 *           }
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This evil query has a complexity score of 2,443,203 - much greater than the default of 1,000!
 *
 * The complexity score is calculated by the [graphql-query-complexity library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-query-complexity),
 * and by default uses the {@link defaultVendureComplexityEstimator}, which is tuned specifically to the Vendure Shop API.
 *
 * {{% alert "warning" %}}
 * Note: By default, if the "take" argument is omitted from a list query (e.g. the `products` or `collections` query), a default factor of 1000 is applied.
 * {{% /alert %}}
 *
 * The optimal max complexity score will vary depending on:
 *
 * - The requirements of your storefront and other clients using the Shop API
 * - The resources available to your server
 *
 * You should aim to set the maximum as low as possible while still being able to service all the requests required.
 * This will take some manual tuning.
 * While tuning the max, you can turn on the `logComplexityScore` to get a detailed breakdown of the complexity of each query, as well as how
 * that total score is derived from its child fields:
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { HardenPlugin } from '\@vendure/harden-plugin';
 *
 * const config: VendureConfig = {
 *   // A detailed summary is logged at the "debug" level
 *   logger: new DefaultLogger({ level: LogLevel.Debug }),
 *   plugins: [
 *      HardenPlugin.init({
 *        maxQueryComplexity: 650,
 *        logComplexityScore: true,
 *      }),
 *   ],
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * With logging configured as above, the following query:
 *
 * ```GraphQL
 * query ProductList {
 *   products(options: { take: 5 }) {
 *     items {
 *       id
 *       name
 *       featuredAsset {
 *         preview
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * will log the following breakdown:
 *
 * ```sh
 * debug 16/12/22, 14:12 - [HardenPlugin] Calculating complexity of [ProductList]
 * debug 16/12/22, 14:12 - [HardenPlugin] Product.id: ID!     childComplexity: 0, score: 1

 * debug 16/12/22, 14:12 - [HardenPlugin] Query.products: ProductList!        childComplexity: 20, score: 35
 * verbose 16/12/22, 14:12 - [HardenPlugin] Query complexity [ProductList]: 35
