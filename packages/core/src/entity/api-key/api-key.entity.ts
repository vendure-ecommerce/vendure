/**
 * @description
 * An ApiKey is mostly used for authenticating non-interactive clients such as scripts
 * or other types of services. An ApiKey is associated with a single {@link User} whose
 * permissions will apply when the ApiKey is used for authorization.
 *
 * Similar to how passwords are handled, only a hash of the API key is stored in the database
 * meaning, generated API-Keys are not viewable after creation, Users are responsible for storing them.
 *
 * If a User forgets their ApiKey, the old one should be deleted and a new one created.
