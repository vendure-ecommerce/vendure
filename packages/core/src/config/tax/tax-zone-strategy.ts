/**
 * @description
 * Defines how the active {@link Zone} is determined for the purposes of calculating taxes.
 *
 * This strategy is used in 2 scenarios:
 *
 * 1. To determine the applicable Zone when calculating the taxRate to apply when displaying ProductVariants. In this case the
 * `order` argument will be undefined, as the request is not related to a specific Order.
 * 2. To determine the applicable Zone when calculating the taxRate on the contents of a specific Order. In this case the
 * `order` argument _will_ be defined, and can be used in the logic. For example, the shipping address can be taken into account.
 *
 * Note that this method is called very often in a typical user session, so any work it performs should be designed with as little
 * performance impact as possible.
