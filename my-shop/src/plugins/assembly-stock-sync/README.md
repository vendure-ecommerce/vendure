# Assembly Stock Sync Plugin

## Overview

This plugin is a temporary solution to get the `stockOnHand` values for 4 part pick products via boomi. This scheduled task runs every 30 mins and starts a job that updates the value at the default stock location. It will be removed later when Aptean adapts Kea or the data sync import.
