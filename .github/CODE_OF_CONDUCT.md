# Vendure Code of Conduct

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to those who wish to contribute to the Vendure project (any repo under the [vendure-ecommerce](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce) organization) by way of issues and pull requests. It also applies to official project communications channels such as Discord.

## Standards

Contributors should conduct themselves according to these guidelines:

1. Treat others as you would wish to be treated.
2. Keep your communication professional<sup>1</sup>.
3. Refrain from unkind or inflammatory communications.

## Enforcement

Contributors and other community members can and should enforce the standard above. The mark of an effective and cohesive group is that the individual members enforce the mores of the group.

However, in certain circumstances a report to the project maintainers may be warranted. In this case, contact us at *contact@vendure.io* so we can deal with it in an appropriate manner.
